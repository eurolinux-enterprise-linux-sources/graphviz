.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gml2gv
converts a graph specified in the GML format to a graph in the GV (formerly DOT) format. 
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-?
Prints usage information and exits.
.TP
.BI \-o "outfile"
Prints output to the file \fIoutfile\fP. If not given, \fBgml2gv\fP

.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in GML.
If no
.I files
operand is specified,
the standard input will be used.
.SH RETURN CODES
Return \fB0\fP
if there were no problems during conversion;
and non-zero if any error occurred.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
As both the graph and graphics models of GV and GML differ significantly, the
conversion is at best approximate. In particular, it is not clear how multiedges
are differentiated in GML, so multiedges are created in GV with no user-available
key. Also, no attribute information is lost, in that
any GML attributes that aren't converted to GV equivalents are retained as
attributes in the output graph.
